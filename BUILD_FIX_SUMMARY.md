# Build Fix Summary - Next.js Static Rendering Errors

## Problem
The application was failing to build due to multiple Next.js static rendering errors. These occurred because certain API routes were using server-side features (request.headers, cookies, request.url) while Next.js was trying to pre-render them statically.

## Root Cause
Next.js 14 with App Router attempts to statically generate all routes by default. When API routes use server-side features like:
- `request.headers.get()`
- `cookies()`
- `request.url`

...they cannot be pre-rendered and need to be marked as dynamic.

## Solution Applied
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all problematic API routes to force server-side rendering:

### Fixed API Routes:
1. `/api/admin/public-analysis-stats/route.ts`
2. `/api/admin/stats/route.ts`
3. `/api/crm/test/route.ts`
4. `/api/crm/stats/route.ts`
5. `/api/crm/debug/route.ts`
6. `/api/leads/count/route.ts`
7. `/api/leads/route.ts`
8. `/api/user/route.ts`

### Additional Fixes:
- Added Suspense wrapper to `/app/register/page.tsx` for useSearchParams
- Added `metadataBase` to `/app/layout.tsx` for proper metadata resolution

## Build Result
✅ Build completed successfully
✅ All static rendering errors resolved
✅ No deployment blockers remaining
✅ Application ready for production deployment

## Performance Optimizations Also Implemented
- Global API cache system to prevent duplicate calls
- React hook optimizations with useCallback and memoization
- Component lifecycle improvements with useRef and Suspense boundaries

## Next Steps
The application is now ready for deployment. The build generates correctly and all static rendering issues have been resolved.
